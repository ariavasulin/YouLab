Need to verify:\n\n1. **API Contract Compatibility**: The Go daemon expects these endpoints from Ralph server:\n   - GET /users/{user_id}/workspace/files - List files with hashes\n   - GET /users/{user_id}/workspace/files/{path} - Download file (with X-File-Hash, X-File-Modified headers)\n   - PUT /users/{user_id}/workspace/files/{path} - Upload file, returns FileMetadata JSON\n   - DELETE /users/{user_id}/workspace/files/{path} - Delete file\n   - POST /users/{user_id}/workspace/sync - Trigger OpenWebUI sync\n\n2. **Data Format Alignment**: Verify WorkspaceIndex and FileMetadata JSON schemas match between Python and Go\n\n## Phase 2 Status (Go Daemon - COMPLETE)\n- Location: tools/youlab-sync/\n- Build verified via Docker (11MB binary, under 15MB target)\n- CLI commands: init, status, sync, watch\n- Features: fsnotify file watching, debouncing, bidirectional sync, YAML config\n\n## Phase 1 Status (Python Server - IN PROGRESS)\n- Parallel agent implementing at src/ralph/api/workspace.py and src/ralph/sync/\n- Need to verify endpoints match expected contract\n\n## Verification Steps\n1. Start Ralph server: uv run ralph-server\n2. Initialize daemon: ./youlab-sync init --server http://localhost:8200 --user-id test --folder /tmp/test\n3. Run one-time sync: ./youlab-sync sync\n4.

The HTML code block is output correctly but the artifact panel fails to render it.\n\n**Symptoms:**\n- Agent calls render_notes tool successfully\n- HTML code block with PDF.js viewer is included in response\n- Preview button in OpenWebUI doesn't display the artifact\n\n**Suspected causes:**\n1. Iframe sandbox restrictions blocking external CDN scripts (pdf.js from cdnjs)\n2. Need 'Allow Same Origin' setting enabled in OpenWebUI artifact settings\n3. Possible OpenWebUI bug with large HTML content\n4. CSP (Content Security Policy) blocking external resources\n\n**Already tried:**\n- Switched from ES modules to UMD build (pdf.js 3.11.174)\n- Added error handling to display load failures\n- Explicit instructions to LLM to include HTML verbatim\n\n**Next steps to investigate:**\n- Check OpenWebUI browser console for errors when clicking preview\n- Test with simpler HTML artifact (no external scripts) to isolate issue\n- Consider bundling pdf.js inline or using data URLs\n- Check OpenWebUI artifact sandbox settings","notes":"Related files:\n- src/ralph/tools/latex_tools.py (PDF_VIEWER_TEMPLATE)\n- thoughts/shared/research/2026-01-28-latex-pdf-live-sandbox-artifacts.md\n- thoughts/shared/plans/2026-01-28-latex-pdf-notes-tool.md\n\nResearch doc mentions iframe sandbox has 'allow-scripts allow-downloads' by default, but loading external scripts may need 'allow-same-origin' which is a user setting.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","owner":"ari@ariavasulin.com","created_at":"2026-01-29T11:43:29.198053-08:00","created_by":"ariavasulin","updated_at":"2026-01-29T11:43:29.198053-08:00"}
